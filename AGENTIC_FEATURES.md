## How It Works

### 1. Continuous Analysis
```
Every time you log an activity:
→ Agent analyzes all patterns
→ Identifies potential issues
→ Generates recommendations
→ Prioritizes by urgency
```

### 2. Intelligent Reasoning
```
Agent considers:
- Time since last activity
- Historical patterns
- Baby's age and development stage
- Correlations between activities
- Active goals and progress
```

### 3. Proactive Intervention
```
Agent provides:
- Clear problem identification
- Reasoning for recommendation
- Step-by-step action plan
- Priority level (high/medium/low)
```

### 4. Goal Management
```
You can:
- Set specific goals
- Agent creates action plans
- Tracks progress automatically
- Adjusts recommendations to achieve goals
```

## Example Agent Behaviors

### Scenario 1: Sleep Deficit
```
Agent detects: Only 3 hours of sleep by 2 PM
Agent reasons: Babies need 12-16 hours total
Agent recommends: Immediate nap intervention
Agent provides: 4-step action plan
Priority: HIGH
```

### Scenario 2: Feeding Pattern
```
Agent detects: 4 hours since last feed
Agent reasons: Typical interval is 2-3 hours
Agent recommends: Prepare for feeding soon
Agent provides: Pre-feeding checklist
Priority: MEDIUM
```

### Scenario 3: Development
```
Agent detects: No tummy time today
Agent reasons: Critical for motor development at this age
Agent recommends: Schedule tummy time session
Agent provides: How-to guide with timing
Priority: MEDIUM
```

### Scenario 4: Routine Optimization
```
Agent analyzes: Feeding before naps = longer sleep
Agent reasons: Full belly helps baby sleep better
Agent recommends: Always feed 15-30 min before nap
Agent provides: New routine template
Priority: LOW (insight)
```
